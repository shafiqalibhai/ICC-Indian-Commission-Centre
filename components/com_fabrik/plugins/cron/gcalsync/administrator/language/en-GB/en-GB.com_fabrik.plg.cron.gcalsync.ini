GCALIDELEMENT=Google ID
GCALIDELEMENTDESC=Element used for event Google ID.  This setting is REQUIRED.  Usually a hidden element, used ONLY by this plugin, to store the unique ID for each Google event.  Needs to be a text element (VARCHAR column) of at least 64 characters.  If you are using the default 'event' table that comes with Fabrik, you may need to add this element (usually called gcal_id), depending on what version you originally installed.
GCALURL=Google URL
GCALURLDESC=Full URL for XML version of the Google Calendar feed you want to import.  This setting is REQUIRED.  This is found by going to the Calendar Settings on the Google page for that calendar, on the XML option for either Calendar Address (will only show public events) or Private Address (will show all events).
GCALUSERIDELEMENT=User ID
GCALUSERIDELEMENTDESC=This setting is OPTIONAL.  If set, the GCal owner email will be matched against your Joomla user table, and if a match is found, the (first) matching user ID will be written to this element (as if they had submitted it directly).
